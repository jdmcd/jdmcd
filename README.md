### Hey there, thanks for visiting 👋
My name is Jimmy and I was previously the CTO of [PATHWAYos](https://pathwayos.com) before it was acquired in October 2023. Currently I'm exploring what's next for me and playing around with some ideas. 

I'm passionate about Server Side Swift and serve as a maintainer of [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) where I wrote the [Queues](https://github.com/vapor/queues) package and help manage the documentation.

In my free time you can most likely find me playing with my dog 🐕. Reach out if you want to chat: [jimmy@jdmcd.io](mailto:jimmy@jdmcd.io).
