### Hey there, thanks for visiting 👋
My name is Jimmy and I'm the CTO of (gotranseo.com)[Transeo]. We believe that the default high-school-to-college pipeline is harmful and that not every student takes the same path, even if the system is built around the assumption they do. We're working to make the educational planning processes around these decisions more equitable and inclusive to impact as many students as possible. 

In addition, I'm passionate about Server Side Swift and serve as a maintainer of (https://vapor.codes)[Vapor] where I wrote the (https://github.com/vapor/queues)[Queues] package and help manage the documentation. As part of my work at Transeo I also help publish (https://github.com/gotranseo)[various open source projects for the EdTech community.]

In my free time you can most likely find me playing with my dogs 🐕. Reach out if you want to chat: (mailto:jdmcd@hey.com)[jdmcd@hey.com].
