### Hey there, thanks for visiting 👋
My name is Jimmy and I am the CEO of [Rubie](https://rubiehq.com). We help companies automate their most complex customer onboarding problems. 

I was previously the CTO of [PathwayOS](https://pathwayos.com) before it was acquired in October 2023. I was heavily involved in the Server Side Swift ecosystem and served as a maintainer of [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) where I wrote the [Queues](https://github.com/vapor/queues) package and helped manage the documentation.

In my free time you can most likely find me playing with my dog 🐕. Reach out if you want to chat: [jimmy@jdmcd.io](mailto:jimmy@jdmcd.io).
